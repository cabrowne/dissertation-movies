Movies 3.1-3.5 are previously published under: Christopher Browne and Sujit Datta, "Elastic turbulence generates anomalous flow resistance in porous media." Science Advances, Vol 7, Issue 45, 2021. https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abj2619


Movie 3.1: Velocity field of example pore (pore B) just below onset of instability ($\dot{\gamma}_I=2.6~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$; $\mathrm{Wi}_I=2.6$). Applied flow is left to right. Each frame is 4 min apart (720x speed). Arrows indicate the vector field, and colors indicate velocity magnitude as measured by particle image velocimetry (PIV). Velocities do not change appreciably over time above the error of PIV.


Movie 3.2: Velocity field of example pore (pore B) above onset of instability ($\dot{\gamma}_I=7.3~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$; $\mathrm{Wi}_I=3.6$). Applied flow is left to right. Each frame is 4 min apart (720x speed). Arrows indicate the vector field, and colors indicate velocity magnitude as measured by particle image velocimetry (PIV). Velocities exhibit strong spatio-temporal fluctuations, consistent with the onset of an elastic instability.


Movie 3.3: Fluctuating velocity field of example pore (pore B) near cusp of instability ($\dot{\gamma}_I=4.8~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$; $\mathrm{Wi}_I=3.2$). Applied flow is left to right. Each frame is 4 min apart (720x speed). Colors indicate fluctuating velocity magnitude as measured by particle image velocimetry (PIV). Right shows kymograph of fluctuating velocity field for an example column of pixels (marked by red lines). Puffs of fluctuations decay in time.


Movie 3.4: Fluctuating velocity field of example pore (pore B) well above onset of instability ($\dot{\gamma}_I=9.7~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$; $\mathrm{Wi}_I=3.9$). Applied flow is left to right. Each frame is 4 min apart (720x speed). Colors indicate fluctuating velocity magnitude as measured by particle image velocimetry (PIV). Right shows kymograph of fluctuating velocity field for an example column of pixels (marked by red lines). Fluctuations are sustained in time.


Movie 3.5: Fluctuating velocity field of example pore (pore B) well above onset of instability ($\dot{\gamma}_I=9.7~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$; $\mathrm{Wi}_I=3.9$) shown at high time resolution. Applied flow is left to right. Each PIV frame averaged over over 1/6 s. Video shown at 5x speed. Colors indicate fluctuating velocity magnitude as measured by particle image velocimetry (PIV). Right shows kymograph of fluctuating velocity field for an example column of pixels (marked by red lines). Fluctuations are sustained in time.

Movie 4.5: Streamlines of flow in stratified medium ($\tilde{k}\approx9$ $\tilde{A}\approx1$) in 10 pores in coarse layer (top, scale bar 100 \textmu m) and 10 pores in fine layer (bottom, scale bar 50 \textmu m) at $\mathrm{Wi}_I=2.7$, just below expected onset of instability in fine layer. Red line demarcates pores labeled stable or unstable by clear crossing of streamlines over time. Videos shown at 25x real time.


Movie 4.6: Streamlines of flow in stratified medium ($\tilde{k}\approx9$ $\tilde{A}\approx1$) in 10 pores in coarse layer (top, scale bar 100 \textmu m) and 10 pores in fine layer (bottom, scale bar 50 \textmu m) at $\mathrm{Wi}_I=3.3$, above the expected onset of instability in fine layer. Red line demarcates pores labeled stable or unstable by clear crossing of streamlines over time. Videos shown at 25x real time.


Movie 4.7: Streamline of flow in an example pore in fine homogeneous medium ($k=8.6~$\textmu$\mathrm{m}^2$) at $\mathrm{Wi}_I=2.4$. The flow is stable in time, indicated by streamlines that do not change over the course of the 5 min real time video. Video is shown at 33x real time. Field of view is 157 \textmu m.


Movie 4.8: Streamline of flow in an example pore in fine homogeneous medium ($k=8.6~$\textmu$\mathrm{m}^2$) at $\mathrm{Wi}_I=3.6$. The flow is stable in time, indicated by streamlines that do not change over the course of the 5 min real time video. Video is shown at 6x real time. Field of view is 157 \textmu m.
